 Changelog
============

v0.13.0 (in work)
------
* Fix incorrect exception messages
* Removed unused functions and compiler specific hacks
* Split the Python and C implementations to simplify building of
  the C library
* Fixed multiple bugs which prevented the use as C library, since some functions
  only got defined when compiling for Python
* Build and deliver python wheels for the library
* Fixed incorrect allocation size in lev_editops_matching_blocks and
  lev_opcodes_matching_blocks

v0.12.1
-------
* Fixed handling of numerous possible wraparounds in calculating the size
  of memory allocations; incorrect handling of which could cause denial
  of service or even possible remote code execution in previous versions
  of the library.

v0.12.0
-------
* Fixed a bug in StringMatcher.StringMatcher.get_matching_blocks /
  extract_editops for Python 3; now allow only `str` editops on
  both Python 2 and Python 3, for simpler and working code.
* Added documentation in the source distribution and in GIT
* Fixed the package layout: renamed the .so/.dll to _levenshtein,
  and made it reside inside a package, along with the StringMatcher
  class.
* Fixed spelling errors.

v0.11.2
-------
* Fixed a bug in setup.py: installation would fail on Python 3 if the locale
  did not specify UTF-8 charset (Felix Yan).

* Added COPYING, StringMatcher.py, gendoc.sh and NEWS in MANIFEST.in, as they
  were missing from source distributions.

v0.11.1
-------
* Added Levenshtein.h to MANIFEST.in

v0.11.0
-------
* Python 3 support, maintainership passed to Antti Haapala

v0.10.1 - v0.10.2
-----------------
* Made python-Lehvenstein Git compatible and use setuptools for PyPi upload
* Created HISTORY.txt and made README reST compatible

v0.10.1 2005-01-13
------------------
* apply_edit() broken for Unicodes was fixed (thanks to Radovan Garabik)
* subtract_edit() function was added

v0.10.0 2004-04-14
------------------
* Hamming distance, Jaro similarity metric and Jaro-Winkler similarity
      metric were added
* ValueErrors raised on wrong argument types were fixed to TypeErrors

v0.9 2003-12-31
---------------
* a poor-but-fast generalized median method quickmedian() was added
* some auxiliary functions added to the C api (lev_set_median_index,
      lev_editops_normalize, ...)

v0.8.2 2003-11-11
-----------------
* fixed missing `static' in the method list

v0.8.1 2003-09-06
-----------------
* some compilation problems with non-gcc were fixed

v0.8.0 2003-05-10
-----------------
* median_improve(), a generalized median improving function, was added
* an arbitrary length limitation imposed on greedy median() result was
      removed
* out of memory should be handled more gracefully (on systems w/o memory
      overcomitting)
* the documentation now passes doctest

v0.7.0 2003-04-09
-----------------
* fixed greedy median() for Unicode characters > U+FFFF, it's now usable
      with whatever integer type wchar_t happens to be
* added missing MANIFEST
* renamed exported C functions, all public names now have lev_, LEV_ or
      Lev prefix; defined lev_byte, lev_wchar, and otherwise santinized
      the (still unstable) C interface
* added edit-ops group of functions, with two interfaces: native, useful
      for string averaging, and difflib-like for interoperability
* added an example SequenceMatcher-like class StringMatcher

v0.6.0 2003-03-31
-----------------
* a segfault in seqratio()/setratio() on invalid input has been fixed
      to an exception
* optimized ratio() and distance() (about 20%)
* Levenshtein.h header file was added to make it easier to actually use
      it as a C library

v0.5.0 2002-12-10
-----------------
* a segfault in setratio() was fixed
* median() handles all empty strings situation more gracefully

v0.4.0 2002-12-09
-----------------
* new functions seqratio() and setratio() computing similarity between
      string sequences and sets
* Levenshtein optimizations (affects all routines except median())
* all Sequence objects are accepted, not just Lists

v0.3.0 2002-12-04
-----------------
* setmedian() finding set median was added
* median() initial overhead for Unicodes was reduced

v0.2.0 2002-12-03
-----------------
* ratio() and distance() now accept both Strings and Unicodes
* removed uratio() and udistance()
* Levenshtein.c is now compilable as a C library (with -DNO_PYTHON)
* a median() function finding approximate weighted median of a string
      set was added

v0.1.0 2002-11-30
-----------------
* Inital release
